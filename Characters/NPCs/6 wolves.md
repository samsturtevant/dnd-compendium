The Wolves crossed paths with [[The Party]] in the foothills soon after the adventurers used [[Characters/NPCs/Elaric the Blightwarden|Elaric]]'s portal to flee the [[Groups/Hollow Root Covenant/Hollow Root Covenant|Hollow Root Covenant]]. Tension sparked a short confrontation, but necessity forced the two sides into a temporary alliance before they separated again.

Twigbeard was removed from the pack when the Wolves learned their supposed seventh lycanthrope was actually a dwarf druid relying on wild shape.
