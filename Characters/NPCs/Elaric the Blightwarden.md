<block>
Appearance: A pale elf whose once-regal features have curdled into something elegant and wrong. His skin is thin as parchment, veined with sluggish ichor, and faintly green-gray like swamp mold. His hair hangs long and colorless, damp as if freshly exhumed.
Eyes: pale gold, clouded with cataract-like mist, yet piercing.
Voice: soft, deliberate
Clothing: Tattered noble robes fused with creeping rot—moss, bone clasps, leech silk.
Presence: Calm, patient, and inevitable
