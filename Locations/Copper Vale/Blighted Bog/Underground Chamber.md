Located beneath the [[Blighted Bog]], this chamber led [[The Party]] to discover the [[Locations/Hollow Root Covenant|Hollow Root Covenant]].
## Discovery
At a circular clearing in the bog, near a perfectly round puddle, [[Barnaby Thistlewick|Barnaby]] identified this magical inscription on the bark of a tree:

> *"Looking down toward the skies*
> *A passage lies for open eyes"*

Noticing that the surface of the water reflected the skies above, [[Lucian Lovelyre|Lucian]] took his clothes off and laid face-down in the puddle. When he opened his eyes, a passageway was revealed beneath the surface.
## Contents
The chamber is filled with thick gnarled roots from the trees growing above the bog. Inside, [[The Party]] discovered a ritual altar and tons of ancient weapons. They also found [[The Rooted One]] who was seated on a throne nearby.

When handling these relics, the party noted that touching more than one piece of equipment at a time would inflict psychic damage. A further discovery revealed that once the weapon made contact with the wielder's blood, it would unlock additional benefits via attunement. These items seem vaguely bloodthirsty once a psychic connection is formed.

The cobbled rear wall was found to be illusory, and as The Party stepped through it was sealed by [[Elaric the Blightwarden|Elaric]] before [[Eva Silverstream|Eva]] and Barnaby could enter.
