An attempt by [[Maera Broadkettle]] to create a night of unforgettable euphoria at the [[Peapod Public House]], this concoction ultimately inflicted severe amnesia upon the original members of [[The Party]] and landed Maera in some legal trouble.

## Ingredients
Stashed in Maera's desk were a handful of dirtied glass vessels along with half a page of shorthand notes:

>1/1 - Hearthsalt/Joyroot tincture. Euphoric, perhaps too dazed.
>1/2 - Hearthsalt/Sunpetal Honey. Intense focus, jittery edge
>1/3 - Laughter Resin/Sunpetal Honey. Heavenly high, hellish comedown
>1/4 - Still recovering from previous test
>1/5 - Laughter Resin/Memory Lace. Dare I say a success.
>1/6 - Laughter Resin/Memory Lace. A success indeed.

## Controversy
This mead was responsible for the near total amnesia experience by [[Tobias Goreguts]], [[Lucian Lovelyre]], [[Timothy Tuttle]], [[Eva Silverstream]], and [[Mundus Decepi]] due to their extreme intoxication at the time.

The [[Enchanters' Guild]] of [[Valeshire]] were particularly concerned in the events of this careless poisoning of the public.

Amongst junk mail, on Maera's desk was found a letter explaining their assessment:

> "This appears to be enchanted with a weak magical effect to obscure memories. However, due to the imprecise nature of this enchantment, it's possible that a novice magician was attempting to invoke the opposite effect. Please note that enchanting food or drink without consent is a serious violation of our magical policies. We require that you disclose the identity of anyone suspected to practice these forbidden enchantments."

On that same desk, an unfinished letter is nearly complete-

> "Thank you for your assessment. We are confident that we know who the culprit is, and we are taking action to ensure that they may never return to this establishment."
